# BackupBitLocker

This C# .NET Framework project produces a binary
that can be used as a start up program in Windows
to backup BitLocker recovery passwords
to Active Directory and Azure Active Directory.
It does so with no console or visible window.
It is essentially a wrapper for a silent PowerShell Script.
